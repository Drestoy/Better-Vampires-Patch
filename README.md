# Better Vampires Light Levels Patch
Nexus link: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63690/?
## What is this mod?

This is a patch for Better Vampires by Brehanin2 (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9717/?) that adds a new option to set the maximum light level value considered as shadow, so any other mod that modifies the light levels should be now compatible (i.e. Improved sneak detection). The original mod sets a static value of 60 to decide if the player is covered by shadows or if he is in direct sunlight. Now you can set that value from 60 to 200 and play with other mods that modify the game light levels.

## Compatibility

Better Vampires is now compatible with Improved sneak detection and any other mod that modifies light levels.

This mod only modifies elements from Better Vampires mod, so it's compatible with anything that doesn't change Better Vampires.

Support for BV Dawnguard, BV Dawnguard ML, BV No Dawnguard and BV No Dawnguard ML versions.

As far as I know it is compatible with Alternative Start - Live Another Life. You only need to load this patch before LAL. Also if you are using mod organizer, you need to put this patch's files before LAL in the installation order windows (left pane).

## Requeriments

* Updated version of Skyrim
* Dawnguard DLC (Only if you are using a DG version of Better Vampires 6.6)
* Better Vampires 6.6 (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9717/?)
* SKSE latest version (http://skse.silverlock.org/)
* SkyUI 4 or higher (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/?)

## Installation/Uninstallation

It's highly recommended to use a mod manager. Everytime you install a mod manually, gasoline price rises. AND please, always keep your backups!!

You can choose between a patch version (which adds a new .esp patch file) or a replacer version (which replaces the original .esp from Better Vampires).

##### If you installed the 1.0 version of this patch:

To update to v1.0.a just uninstall the old version and install the new one. 

##### If you are installing LLP for the first time:

You can consider this as an unofficial update for Better Vampires 6.6, so the installation is basically the same process as installing/upgrading Better Vampires. You only need to install this patch at the same time as Better Vampires while following the steps Brehanin2 wrote in his web: https://sites.google.com/site/bettervampires/install-upgrade-uninstall

Either you are installing or updating, the steps are the same. Just install this patch at the same time as Better Vampires mod.

## How to use it?

Once you have installed the patch, you will have a new slider option in 'General options' tab of the Better Vampires MCM. You don't need to feed in order to get changes to work, simply change the value to your taste.

## Issues

This patch doesn't modify anything about how Better Vampires works. It only adds compatibility with any mod that changes light levels so every functionality from Better Vampires will work the same way.

If you find any problem relating to light levels, please create a new issue here: https://github.com/Drestoy/Better-Vampires-Patch/issues
